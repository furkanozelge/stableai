# Stable Diffusion AI Project

The Stable Diffusion AI Project is a deep learning project that uses text-to-image, image-to-image, and style-transfer features to provide high-quality image synthesis. The project uses the Stable Diffusion algorithm, which is a powerful technique for generating realistic images from a given text description or image input.

## Features

The Stable Diffusion AI Project offers several key features that make it a powerful tool for image synthesis:

- :pencil2: **Text-to-image synthesis:** Generate high-quality images from text descriptions using the Stable Diffusion algorithm.
- :framed_picture: **Image-to-image synthesis:** Generate new images from existing ones by applying the Stable Diffusion algorithm to the original image.
- :art: **Style-transfer synthesis:** Apply the style of one image to another using the Stable Diffusion algorithm.

## Frontend

The frontend of this project is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/). Next.js is a popular framework for building server-side rendered React applications, while Chakra UI is a popular component library for building accessible and responsive user interfaces.

The frontend allows users to interact with the Stable Diffusion AI Project and generate new images from text descriptions or existing images. Users can also customize the output images by adjusting various parameters and settings.

## How to Use

Using the Stable Diffusion AI Project is easy. Simply follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies (see the Installation section below).
2. Clone the Stable Diffusion AI Project repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the frontend directory and run `npm install` to install the frontend dependencies.
4. Start the frontend development server by running `npm run dev`.
5. Use the web interface to generate new images from text descriptions or existing images.
6. Enjoy your high-quality synthesized images!
